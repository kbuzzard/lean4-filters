# lean4-filters

This is just an experimental project helping me to learn about
how Lean 4 looks, and how it differs from Lean 3. My goals
right now:

1) [done] Define lattices and prove that `Set X` is a lattice.

2) [done] Define complete lattices and prove `Set X` is a complete lattice.

3) [done] Define `map` and `comap` for `Set` and prove they're a Galois connection.

4) Define filters and do the same sort of thing for them.

## Proofs

I am playing around with term mode and tactic mode proofs; ultimately I am
interested in seeing if I can turn this into a way that mathematicians
can learn how to use Lean 4.
